I am a SNSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University in the Department of Statistics mentored by Susan Holmes. 

In 2012, I obtained my joint PhD co-advised by Xavier Pennec & Mauricio Reyes at Inria in France & University of Bern in Switzerland. 

My research focuses on the statistical analysis of medical imaging data. Recently, I started to combine heterogeneous brain data (structural and diffusion images with cognitive tests). I like to work application-driven and explore interesting theoretical problems along the way.
