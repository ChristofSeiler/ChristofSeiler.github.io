## Computational Immunology

Statistical consulting and methods developement for several projects in immunology using RNA-seq, microarrays, and CyTOF data.

In collaboration with [Catherine Blish](https://sites.stanford.edu/blishlab/) and her [lab](https://sites.stanford.edu/blishlab/) at Stanford School of Medicine

## Bayesian Functional Brain Connectivity

A Bayesian analysis of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data.

* Paper: submitted

In collaboration with [Allan L. Reiss](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/allan-reiss) and his [lab](http://cibsr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford School of Medicine 

## Data Integration and Analysis in Neuroscience

In this project, we combine heterogeneous brain data (structural and diffusion images with cognitive tests) to explain how neuroanatomical differences are associated with cognition in girls with Turner syndrome. 

In collaboration with [Allan L. Reiss](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/allan-reiss) and his [lab](http://cibsr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford School of Medicine

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo in High Dimensions

In this project, we estimate running times of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in high dimensions using Riemannian geometry and coarse Ricci curvature. This has applications in sampling form high dimensional posterior distributions arising in computational anatomy. 

* Paper: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1114), [NIPS](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5500-positive-curvature-and-hamiltonian-monte-carlo.pdf)
* Poster: [pdf](https://christofseiler.github.io/NIPS-Poster.pdf)
* Software: [github](https://christofseiler.github.io/BayesianImageRegistration)

## Clustering of Deformation Fields in Compuational Anatomy

In this project, we infer regions of interests from a set of deformation vector fields using Bayesian Nonparametrics.

## Hierarchical Modeling in Compuational Anatomy

In this project, we introduce structured diffeomorphic deformations to handle multiscale anatomical organs, e.g. mandibles. We propose a novel hierarchical structure and a general linear model for deformations.

## Modeling of Soft Tissue Deformations with Markov Random Fields

In this project, we implement fast GPU code using shader processing to model soft tissue deformations with Markov Random Fields.
