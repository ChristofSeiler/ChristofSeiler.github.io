<b>Bio</b>: I earned my PhD in computer science and biomedical engineering in Switzerland and France. Together with my advisors, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/">Xavier Pennec</a> and <a href="https://www.mauricioreyes.me/">Mauricio Reyes</a>, we worked on medical image registration algorithms. Then, I moved to the Department of Statistics at Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow and later as a research scientist. Together with my advisor, <a href="https://susan.su.domains">Susan Holmes</a>, we worked on a wide range of topics in mathematical and applied statistics. Together with <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/blishlab.html">Catherine Blish</a> and her lab, we developed the R package CytoGLMM. Now, I am building my own research group in statistics at the <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dacs">Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a> in the Netherlands.
