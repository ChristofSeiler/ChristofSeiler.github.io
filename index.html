<b>Bio</b>: I earned my PhD in Switzerland and France. With my advisors, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/">Xavier Pennec</a> and <a href="https://www.mauricioreyes.me/">Mauricio Reyes</a>, we worked on statistical models for medical images. For my postdoc, I moved to the Department of Statistics at Stanford University. With my advisor, <a href="https://susan.su.domains">Susan Holmes</a>, we worked on mathematical and applied statistics. With <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/blishlab.html">Catherine Blish</a> and her lab, we developed the R package CytoGLMM. Now, I am building my own research group in statistics at the <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dacs">Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a> in the Netherlands.
