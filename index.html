<b>Bio</b>: I earned my PhD in computer science and biomedical engineering in Switzerland and France. After graduating, I moved to the Department of Statistics at Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow and later as a research scientist. Together with my advisor, Susan Holmes, I worked on a wide range of topics in mathematical and applied statistics. In close collaboration with the Blish lab at Stanford, we developed the R package CytoGLMM for differential analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data. As a faculty member at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, I am currently building my own research group in statistics.
